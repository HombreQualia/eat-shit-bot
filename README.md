This is a twitter bot to retweet people who use a certain phrase. Currently, that phrase is "eat shit".

### How it works

To run, you need to create a `credentials.js` file, similar to the `credentials.example.js` file but with actual twitter credentials in it. Then, just:


```
$ node app.js
```

and your twitter bot should run.
